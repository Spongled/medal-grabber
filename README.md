# Medal Grabber

A customisable clip grabber and downloader for popular social clipping app: https://medal.tv

## Usage

* Select an amount of clips from `Choose clip amount` and the most recent clips from any game will be fetched from the API.
* Specify a game by using `Choose game` (which also supports custom input).

Medal Grabber will automatically grab clips every time you change a property.

## Additionally:

* Click the `Settings` badge or `up arrow icon` to collapse the property panel.
